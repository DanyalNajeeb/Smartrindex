                        These terms are broken down into 5 very simple parts. The 6<sup>th</sup>
                        
                    part is legal jargon:

                <h3>
                    
                        1. What Smartr software is and what it does for vendors, customers, and
                        promoters.
                    
                </h3>
                <p>
                    
                        No matter what brand is using Smartr software, whether it is
                        SmartrMarketing (an app where you can purchase this software for your
                        business), a SmartrHoldings company, or a vendor (brand or company
                        white-labeling Smartr software for their business), Smartr software
                        allows companies to easily setup an Active Affiliate program or simple
                        ecommerce program for their customers. This allows customers to actively
                        refer other customers to a brand, and earn income as a promoter when
                        someone makes a qualifying purchase under someone’s shared referral
                        code, and generally, allows those vendors to sell their products and
                        services to customers. No matter what brand you purchase from, as the
                        chosen merchant services provider, you will receive a receipt from
                        SmartrCommerce.
                    
                </p>
                <h3>2. How vendors get paid.</h3>
                <p>
                        Vendors are Smartr customers who are white-labeling Smartr software for
                        their business(es). Vendors get paid for their brand’s purchases weekly,
                        on Fridays, after they have earned $100 dollars, and each product or
                        service sold has passed the 14-day return policy that is put in place
                        for all Smartr brands and Smartr vendors, although any brand can choose
                        to have a zero-return policy. This means there can be a delay of up to 2
                        weeks before your first payment from SmartrCommerce. A 3% + .35 cent
                        processing fee is attached to each transaction, and vendors should
                        expect to receive form 1099-K by January 31st of the following tax year.
                        Processing fee is subject to change without notice.
                    </p>
                <h3>3. How promoters get paid.</h3>
                <p>
                    
                        Promoters are users or customers who decide to share their assigned
                        referral code with other users or customers. When those customers make
                        purchases with any Smartr brand or Smartr vendor, they may be able to
                        receive a percentage of those transactions as a reward for referring new
                        customers to the participating brand. The amount per transaction is
                        subject to change without notice, and any amount earned in any brand is
                        independent of all other brands or transactions. Once a person has
                        earned at least $100 dollars in earnings within any solitary brand, and
                        so long as those earnings from a purchase have passed the 14-day return
                        policy that is put in place for all Smartr brands and Smartr vendor
                        purchases, earnings will be paid weekly, on Fridays.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                        In order to receive earnings, you will have to authorize SmartrCommerce
                        to send you a payment via ACH into a qualifying checking account, as
                        well as fill out a 1099 for Smartr.
                    </p>
                <h3>4. How customers can become promoters.</h3>
                <p>
                        Customers can become promoters by sharing their own referral code.
                        Earnings are independent of discounts or purchases. Each independent
                        brand using Smartr software assigns its users with a unique referral
                        code and network of users. This means, your earnings made in one brand
                        do not reflect earnings made in another brand, and terms of payment for
                        those earnings can vary by brand. Please read the FAQ with any brand for
                        questions about earnings qualifiers. Each brand will have a FAQ from
                        both Smartr and any Smartr vendor using Smartr software.
                    </p>

                            5. Return policy, and returns in regards to vendor and promoter
                            earnings.
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                                Any and all brands using Smartr software have a maximum 14-day return
                                policy. This is because Smartr brands and vendors using the software are
                                totally awesome, and deliver great value to their customers, which
                                minimizes the needs for any returns. We also have an affiliate
                                commission program in place that needs to run efficiently, so this
                                return policy makes sure all customers, vendors, and promoters are happy
                                with each transaction. Any brand or vendor can choose to have a
                                zero-return policy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Promoter earnings may be subject to adjustments for chargebacks or
                                    refunds. If a customer purchases a product or service after having used
                                    your referral code, and then later returns an item, your earnings amount
                                    will be adjusted for the amount of earnings initially paid for that
                                    purchase.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                Customers are urged to work directly with a Smartr vendor when
                                requesting a return. If your Smartr vendor is not fulfilling your goals
                                or needs, please notify us at <a href="mailto:info@thesmartrapp.com">info@thesmartrapp.com</a>

                    By authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Smartr to process
                    such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as
                    electronic drafts from your designated account (in the case of Automated
                    Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated
                    account (in the case of credit/debit card or similar payments)
                    (collectively, "Electronic Payments"). Any subsequent fees are generally
                    billed or charged in advance of the applicable recurring/subscription
                    period. If any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or
                    similar transaction is rejected or denied, Smartr or its service
                    providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item,
                    rejection, or insufficient funds fee and to process any such payment as
                    an Electronic Payment.

                    Automatic Renewal: Provided that automatic renewals are allowed in your
                    state, we will inform you by email before automatically renewing your
                    Services, unless purchased on a subscription basis. Once we have
                    informed you that the Services will be automatically renewed, Smartr may
                    automatically renew your Services and charge you the then current price
                    for the renewal term. We will also remind you that we will bill your
                    chosen payment method for the Services renewal, whether it was on file
                    on the renewal date or provided later. We will also provide you with
                    instructions on how you may cancel the Services. You must cancel the
                    Services before the renewal date to avoid being billed for the renewal.
